            <h1>Welcome to My Professional Portfolio</h1>
            <p>Hello! I'm Richard Diazdeleon, currently a graduate student at California State University, Long Beach, finalizing my Master's degree in Applied Statistics. My passion for data science and analytics is the driving force behind my academic and professional endeavors.</p>
            <p>Previously, I had the opportunity to work at Kaiser Permanente, where I was part of a dynamic team focusing on data science and marketing. This role allowed me to apply and hone my analytical skills in a practical setting, contributing significantly to data-driven projects.</p>
            <p>My educational journey in the field of data science began at California State University, Fullerton, where I obtained a Bachelor of Arts in Applied Mathematics. This foundational education laid the groundwork for my current pursuits and future aspirations in the realm of data analytics and statistics.</p>
